    	        <h2>Bikes on the GO Train</h2>
                <p>You can take your bike on the GO Train. Free of charge. This allows you to get to UTSC from any GO Train station on the Lakeshore East Line. There are some restriction though. For example, you can't take your bike into Union Station during rush-hour. Check the <a href="http://www.gotransit.com/public/en/travelling/leaveyourcar.aspx">GO website</a> for the specifics. In short: if the train is packed, you can't take your bike on the train unless it's a folding bike. For my route, coming from Danforth GO Station, this is not an issue. In fact, sometimes I'm the only person in the train car.</p>

    	        <h2>Highland Creek Trail</h2>
                <p>
                You want to exit the GO Train at Guildwood Station. 
                From there, cross Kingston Road and say goodbye to cars.
                You won't see another one for the remainder of your commute. 
                Next, you're passing lovely Greenvale Park and enter the Highland Creek Trail.
                It's a paved recreational trail, ideal for cycling. 
                However, there is no winter maintenance - something to keep in mind during the winter months. 
                Every other season, however, is a treat! 
                You'll see a lot of wildlife: deer, rabits, coyotes, foxes, owls, and all kinds of other birds.
                While on the trail, just follow Highland Creek. 
                It's all downhill which makes the cycling even more enjoyable.

    	        <h2>Getting to UTSC</h2>
                <p>
                Once you've passed Morningside Park, you'll enter University grounds. 
                You pass a metal bridge and then turn left, slightly uphill.
                The last few meters are relatively steep and you want to walk.
                You can either lock your bike somewhere in the valley or take it to the upper campus.
                I usually take it to campus, where it seems a little safer.
                Note that if you have an office and it's large enough, just take your bike inside. 
                And in case you need to fix something at your bike, UTSC has a bike repair station, located between the AA Building and the Student Centre.

                <p>
                Once it's time to head home, go back down the valley from the main UTSC campus.
                You continue downhill on the trail that follows Highland Creek. 
                This passes the UTSC playing fields and tennis courts where the Pan Am Games were held.
                You cross Old Kingston Road and pass through Colonel Danforth Park, then the
                Lower Highland Creek Park. 
                As you go further downstream, the vegetation changes quite a bit, you'll see a lot of ferns.
                And keep an eye open for Trilliums in the spring!

    	        <h2>Waterfront Trail</h2>
                <p>
                After you pass under the GO rail tracks, you reach Lake Ontario. 
                This sudden change of scenery from a ravine and dense forest to the fast openness of Lake Ontario is quite impressive.
                If you're lucky you might even catch a rainbow. 
                When you're done taking picture of the rainbow, cross the metal bridges and turn left, following the Waterfront Trails. 
                Winds in Toronto are typically coming from the west, which means you'll have a pleasent tail wind on most days.
