                 <h2>Introduction to Scientific Computing (PSCB57)</h2>
                    <p>
                    <i>From the calendar:</i> Scientific computing is a rapidly growing field because computers can solve previously intractable problems and simulate natural processes governed by equations that do not have analytic solutions. During the first part of this course, students will learn numerical algorithms for various standard tasks such as root finding, integration, data fitting, interpolation and visualization. In the second part, students will learn how to model real-world systems from various branches of science. At the end of the course, students will be expected to write small programs by themselves. Assignments will regularly include programming exercises.
                    </p>
               <h3>Updates</h3>
               <h4>August 6th 2020</h4>

               You can now download a <a href="./teaching/PSCB57_2020/syllabus.pdf">preliminary syllabus</a>. This is not the final version, but it should give you a rough idea what to expect.

               <p>
               Due to COVID-19, there will be significant changes to how this course is run compared to previous years. 
               As we get closer to the beginning of term, I will provide more updates here. For now, the basics: 
               <ul>
                   <li>The entire course will be offered exclusively online. No in-person lectures or tutorials will be offered.</li>
                   <li>The lectures will be offered synchronously and asynchronously. This means you can either watch the lectures live and participate with quetions, or watch a recording of the lecture later.  </li>
                   <li>The tutorial will require your synchronous attendance. There will be short quizzes during the tutorials. </li>
                   <li>You will need access to a computer. Ideally you should be able to run python3 (with jupyter notebooks, numpy, and matplotlib) on your personal computer. If your personal computer does not support this software, you can use a cloud service as well. However, this means you are (even more) reliable on a decent internet connection.</li>
               </ul>
               </p>

                <h2>(Winter 2019) Mechanics: From Oscillations to Chaos (PHYB54)</h2>
                <i>From the calendar:</i> The linear, nonlinear and chaotic behaviour of classical mechanical systems such as oscillators, rotating bodies, and central field systems. The course will develop analytical and numerical tools to solve such systems and determine their basic properties. The course will include mathematical analysis, numerical exercises (Python), and demonstrations of mechanical systems.

                    <i>From the calendar:</i> Scientific computing is a rapidly growing field because computers can solve previously intractable problems and simulate natural processes governed by equations that do not have analytic solutions. During the first part of this course, students will learn numerical algorithms for various standard tasks such as root finding, integration, data fitting, interpolation and visualization. In the second part, students will learn how to model real-world systems from various branches of science. At the end of the course, students will be expected to write small programs by themselves. Assignments will regularly include programming exercises.

                 <h2>(Fall 2016) Introduction to Scientific Computing (PSCB57)</h2>
                    <i>From the calendar:</i> Scientific computing is a rapidly growing field because computers can solve previously intractable problems and simulate natural processes governed by equations that do not have analytic solutions. During the first part of this course, students will learn numerical algorithms for various standard tasks such as root finding, integration, data fitting, interpolation and visualization. In the second part, students will learn how to model real-world systems from various branches of science. At the end of the course, students will be expected to write small programs by themselves. Assignments will regularly include programming exercises.
